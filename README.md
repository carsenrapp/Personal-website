My personal website.

Created to be hosted with Netlify, images are stored and delivered with Cloudinary.

You'll need a configInfo.js file in the src folder if you want to user your own images.


```
let configIfo = { 
   cloud_name: 'crsnrpp', 
   api_key: '482173371962992', 
   api_secret: 'uypFnUmSo9bzHatGAqLGp36f-L8' 
 }

export default configIfo 

```
