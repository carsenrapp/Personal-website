My personal website.

Hosted with Netlify, images are stored and delivered with Cloudinary.

You'll need a configInfo.js file in the src folder if you want to use your own images.


```
let configIfo = { 
   cloud_name: 'myusername', 
   api_key: '123456789', 
   api_secret: 'abcdefghijk-l7' 
 }

export default configIfo 

```
